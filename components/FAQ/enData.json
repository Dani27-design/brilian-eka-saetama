        "question": "How do fire sprinkler systems work?",
        "answer": "Fire sprinkler systems work by detecting heat from a fire, which activates individual sprinkler heads. Contrary to popular belief, not all sprinklers activate at once - only those in the immediate area of the fire. The water flows through pipes from a water supply, effectively controlling or extinguishing the fire."

        "question": "How often should fire safety equipment be inspected?",
        "answer": "Fire safety equipment should be inspected regularly according to local regulations and manufacturer recommendations. Generally, fire extinguishers require annual professional inspections, while visual checks should be performed monthly. Fire alarm systems typically need testing twice a year, and sprinkler systems should be inspected quarterly."

        "question": "What types of fire extinguishers do I need for my building?",
        "answer": "The types of fire extinguishers needed depend on the potential fire hazards in your building. Class A extinguishers are for ordinary combustibles, Class B for flammable liquids, Class C for electrical fires, Class D for metal fires, and Class K for kitchen fires. Many commercial buildings use ABC multi-purpose extinguishers, while commercial kitchens require Class K extinguishers."

        "question": "Are smoke detectors and fire alarms the same thing?",
        "answer": "No, smoke detectors and fire alarms are not the same thing. Smoke detectors are individual sensors that detect smoke and emit a local alarm. Fire alarm systems are comprehensive networks that may include smoke detectors, heat detectors, manual pull stations, and notification devices, all connected to a central control panel that can alert occupants and emergency services."

        "question": "How can I create an effective fire evacuation plan?",
        "answer": "To create an effective fire evacuation plan, identify all possible exits, establish clear evacuation routes, designate assembly points away from the building, assign roles to specific individuals, make provisions for disabled persons, and conduct regular fire drills. The plan should be documented, distributed to all occupants, and visibly posted throughout the building."
